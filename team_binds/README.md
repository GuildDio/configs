# Role-specific team binds

## Usage

Download this folder (<instruction for github interface here> or using Git),
copy all the files to your base openarena directory (`~/.openarena/baseoa` for Linux).
Then type `/exec <your_role>.cfg` from OA game console, on the server you are going to play.

## Requirments

You need to have 1-0 (all numeric keys) free (unbound).
If you have something bound, change the binds before execing this config.

## Theory

The basic knowledge of CTF strategy is a must to use the binds properly,
please read [the guide][guide-link] about roles in CTF.
*Opening cfg files and reading them will help a lot too, there are comments for each bind inside.*
